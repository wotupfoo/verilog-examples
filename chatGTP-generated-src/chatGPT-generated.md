Certainly! Here's an updated version of the Verilog program that detects the clock rate of a PSK signal with a 1MHz sample rate and then decodes it:

```verilog
module PSKDecoderWithClockDetection (
  input wire clk,
  input wire psk_signal,
  output reg decoded_data
);

reg [15:0] count;
reg [15:0] prev_count;
reg sample_flag;
reg [1:0] psk_state;
reg detect_clock_rate;
reg [15:0] clock_rate;

parameter THRESHOLD = 2000; // Adjust this threshold based on the expected clock rate

always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Detect the rising or falling edge of the PSK signal
  if (psk_signal != psk_state) begin
    // Toggle the sample flag to capture the data at the edge
    sample_flag <= ~sample_flag;
  end
  
  // Increment the count on each clock cycle
  count <= count + 1;
  
  if (sample_flag) begin
    // Calculate the clock rate based on the number of clock cycles between phase changes
    clock_rate <= count - prev_count;
    // Store the current count for the next phase change
    prev_count <= count;
    
    // If the clock rate is detected, set the flag to start decoding
    if (detect_clock_rate == 0 && clock_rate > THRESHOLD) begin
      detect_clock_rate <= 1;
      decoded_data <= psk_signal;
    end
  end
  
  if (detect_clock_rate) begin
    // Update the decoded data at the detected clock rate
    if (count == clock_rate/2) begin
      decoded_data <= psk_signal;
    end
  end
  
  psk_state <= psk_signal;
end

endmodule
```

Explanation:
- This program extends the clock detection functionality from the previous program and adds the decoding logic.
- The `detect_clock_rate` register is used as a flag to indicate whether the clock rate has been detected or not.
- The `clock_rate` register is used to store the estimated clock rate based on the number of clock cycles between phase changes.
- The `THRESHOLD` parameter is a user-defined threshold value to determine whether the detected clock rate is valid or not. You may need to adjust this value based on the expected clock rate of your PSK signal.
- When a phase change is detected, the `clock_rate` is calculated and compared against the threshold. If the `clock_rate` is greater than the threshold and the `detect_clock_rate` flag is not set, the `detect_clock_rate` flag is set, indicating that the clock rate has been detected.
- Once the clock rate is detected, the decoding process begins. The `decoded_data` is updated at every half period of the clock rate. The `count` register is used to keep track of the current clock cycle count.
- The `psk_state` register is used to store the previous value of `psk_signal`.
- Note that this program assumes binary PSK encoding, where there are only two possible phase states represented by `0` and `1` in the `decoded_data` output. If your PSK encoding uses more than two phase states, you will need to modify the decoding logic accordingly. 


Certainly! Here's a Verilog testbench for the PSKDecoderWithClockDetection module:

```verilog
module PSKDecoderWithClockDetection_TB;

  reg clk;
  reg psk_signal;
  wire decoded_data;
  
  // Instantiate the module under test
  PSKDecoderWithClockDetection dut (
    .clk(clk),
    .psk_signal(psk_signal),
    .decoded_data(decoded_data)
  );

  // Clock generation
  always #5 clk = ~clk;

  // Stimulus
  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    psk_signal = 0;
    #10;

    // Send PSK-encoded signal with known clock rate
    #10 psk_signal = 1;
    #10 psk_signal = 0;
    #10 psk_signal = 1;
    #10 psk_signal = 0;
    #10 psk_signal = 1;

    // Wait for decoding to start
    #200;

    // Send PSK-encoded data at the detected clock rate
    repeat (10) begin
      #100 psk_signal = ~psk_signal;
    end

    // End simulation
    #10 $finish;
  end

endmodule
```

Explanation:
- The testbench module instantiates the `PSKDecoderWithClockDetection` module and provides the necessary connections to its ports.
- The `clk` and `psk_signal` signals are defined as registers in the testbench.
- The `decoded_data` signal is defined as a wire and represents the output of the PSK decoder.
- The testbench includes a clock generation process that toggles the `clk` signal every 5 time units.
- The stimulus section of the testbench applies a known PSK-encoded signal to the `psk_signal` input.
- After a delay of 200 time units, the testbench starts sending PSK-encoded data at the detected clock rate (assuming the clock rate has been detected correctly).
- In this example, the PSK-encoded data alternates between 0 and 1 every 100 time units for a total of 10 cycles.
- Finally, the simulation is terminated using `$finish` after a delay of 10 time units.

Please note that this testbench assumes that the clock detection and decoding process in the `PSKDecoderWithClockDetection` module is functioning correctly. You may need to customize the stimulus and expected output based on your specific PSK encoding and clock rate. 

Certainly! Here's an updated version of the linear timecode decoder in Verilog that includes a valid packet check and checksum verification:

```verilog
module TimecodeDecoder(
  input wire clk,
  input wire rst,
  input wire [79:0] timecode,
  output reg [3:0] hours,
  output reg [6:0] minutes,
  output reg [6:0] seconds,
  output reg [23:0] frames,
  output reg valid
);

  reg [3:0] hours_reg;
  reg [6:0] minutes_reg;
  reg [6:0] seconds_reg;
  reg [23:0] frames_reg;
  reg valid_reg;
  
  always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
      hours_reg <= 0;
      minutes_reg <= 0;
      seconds_reg <= 0;
      frames_reg <= 0;
      valid_reg <= 0;
    end
    else begin
      if (timecode[79] && checkPacket(timecode)) begin
        // Valid timecode detected with a valid packet
        valid_reg <= 1;
        hours_reg <= timecode[78:75];
        minutes_reg <= timecode[74:68];
        seconds_reg <= timecode[67:61];
        frames_reg <= timecode[60:37];
      end
      else begin
        valid_reg <= 0;
      end
    end
  end
  
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
      hours <= 0;
      minutes <= 0;
      seconds <= 0;
      frames <= 0;
      valid <= 0;
    end
    else begin
      // Output the values from the registers
      hours <= hours_reg;
      minutes <= minutes_reg;
      seconds <= seconds_reg;
      frames <= frames_reg;
      valid <= valid_reg;
    end
  end
  
  function automatic bit checkPacket(input wire [79:0] packet) ;
    integer i;
    reg [7:0] checksum;
    begin
      checksum = 8'h00;
      for (i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
        checksum = checksum + packet[i * 8 +: 8];
      end
      if (checksum == 8'hFF)
        return 1;
      else
        return 0;
    end
  endfunction

endmodule
```

In this updated version, a `valid` output signal has been added to indicate whether a valid timecode packet has been detected or not.

The `checkPacket` function calculates a checksum by summing up the individual bytes of the timecode packet and verifies if the checksum equals 0xFF. If the checksum matches, it returns a value of 1, indicating a valid packet. Otherwise, it returns a value of 0.

Within the `always` block, the module checks if the timecode input has its most significant bit (`timecode[79]`) set, indicating a valid timecode. It then calls the `checkPacket` function to verify the packet's integrity. If the timecode is valid and the packet passes the checksum verification, the internal registers and the `valid` signal are updated accordingly.

As before, the decoded values for hours, minutes, seconds, and frames are outputted in subsequent clock cycles using separate output registers (`hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, `frames`).

Remember to instantiate this `TimecodeDecoder` module in your top-level design and connect the appropriate clock, reset, and timecode signals.

Please note that this implementation assumes a specific format and checksum





Certainly! Here's a Verilog program for a PSK encoder:

```verilog
module PSKEncoder (
  input wire clk,
  input wire data,
  output reg psk_signal
);

reg [15:0] count;
reg [15:0] prev_count;
reg sample_flag;
reg [1:0] psk_state;
reg detect_clock_rate;
reg [15:0] clock_rate;

parameter THRESHOLD = 2000; // Adjust this threshold based on the expected clock rate

always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Detect the rising or falling edge of the PSK signal
  if (data != psk_state) begin
    // Toggle the sample flag to capture the data at the edge
    sample_flag <= ~sample_flag;
  end

  // Increment the count on each clock cycle
  count <= count + 1;

  if (sample_flag) begin
    // Calculate the clock rate based on the number of clock cycles between phase changes
    clock_rate <= count - prev_count;
    // Store the current count for the next phase change
    prev_count <= count;

    // If the clock rate is detected, set the flag to start encoding
    if (detect_clock_rate == 0 && clock_rate > THRESHOLD) begin
      detect_clock_rate <= 1;
      psk_signal <= data;
    end
  end

  if (detect_clock_rate) begin
    // Update the encoded PSK signal at the detected clock rate
    if (count == clock_rate/2) begin
      psk_signal <= ~psk_signal;
    end
  end

  psk_state <= data;
end

endmodule
```

Explanation:
- This program is an encoder version based on the previous PSK decoder program with clock detection.
- The `data` input represents the data to be encoded.
- The `psk_signal` output is the PSK-encoded signal.
- The `detect_clock_rate` register is used as a flag to indicate whether the clock rate has been detected or not.
- The `clock_rate` register is used to store the estimated clock rate based on the number of clock cycles between phase changes.
- The `THRESHOLD` parameter is a user-defined threshold value to determine whether the detected clock rate is valid or not. You may need to adjust this value based on the expected clock rate of your PSK signal.
- When a phase change is detected, the `clock_rate` is calculated and compared against the threshold. If the `clock_rate` is greater than the threshold and the `detect_clock_rate` flag is not set, the `detect_clock_rate` flag is set, indicating that the clock rate has been detected.
- Once the clock rate is detected, the encoding process begins. The `psk_signal` is updated at every half period of the clock rate. The `count` register is used to keep track of the current clock cycle count.
- The `psk_state` register is used to store the previous value of `data`.
- The encoded PSK signal is generated by toggling the `psk_signal` at every half period of the clock rate.

Please note that this encoder assumes binary PSK encoding, where there are only two possible phase states represented by `0` and `1` in the `psk_signal` output. If your PSK encoding uses more than two phase states, you will need to modify the encoding logic accordingly.

Certainly! Here's a testbench for the PSKEncoder module:

```verilog
module PSKEncoder_TB;

  reg clk;
  reg data;
  wire psk_signal;
  
  // Instantiate the module under test
  PSKEncoder dut (
    .clk(clk),
    .data(data),
    .psk_signal(psk_signal)
  );

  // Clock generation
  always #5 clk = ~clk;

  // Stimulus
  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    data = 0;
    #10;

    // Send data to be encoded
    #10 data = 1;
    #10 data = 0;
    #10 data = 1;
    #10 data = 0;
    #10 data = 1;

    // Wait for encoding to start
    #200;

    // Capture the encoded PSK signal
    repeat (10) begin
      #100;
    end

    // End simulation
    #10 $finish;
  end

endmodule
```

Explanation:
- The testbench module instantiates the `PSKEncoder` module and provides the necessary connections to its ports.
- The `clk` and `data` signals are defined as registers in the testbench.
- The `psk_signal` signal is defined as a wire and represents the output of the PSK encoder.
- The testbench includes a clock generation process that toggles the `clk` signal every 5 time units.
- The stimulus section of the testbench applies a known data sequence to the `data` input.
- After a delay of 200 time units, the testbench waits for the encoding process to start.
- The testbench then waits for 10 cycles, capturing the encoded PSK signal at each cycle.
- Finally, the simulation is terminated using `$finish` after a delay of 10 time units.

Please note that this testbench assumes that the encoding process in the `PSKEncoder` module is functioning correctly. You may need to customize the stimulus and expected output based on your specific requirements for PSK encoding.


Certainly! Here's an example of a linear timecode encoder and a test bench in Verilog:

```verilog
module TimecodeEncoder(
  input wire [3:0] hours,
  input wire [6:0] minutes,
  input wire [6:0] seconds,
  input wire [23:0] frames,
  output reg [79:0] timecode
);

  always @* begin
    timecode = {1'b1, hours, minutes, seconds, frames};
    timecode[79:64] = ~timecode[79:64]; // Invert the first 16 bits for checksum calculation
    timecode[63:56] = ~(timecode[7:0] + timecode[15:8] + timecode[23:16] + timecode[31:24] +
                        timecode[39:32] + timecode[47:40] + timecode[55:48] + timecode[63:56]); // Calculate checksum
  end

endmodule
```

In this example, the `TimecodeEncoder` module takes inputs `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, and `frames`, and generates the corresponding linear timecode in the `timecode` output.

The timecode is constructed by concatenating the input values with a leading bit of '1' to indicate a valid timecode. The first 16 bits of the timecode are inverted to prepare for checksum calculation. The checksum is calculated by summing up the individual bytes of the timecode and taking the one's complement of the result. The checksum value is then assigned to the last 8 bits of the timecode.

Here's a test bench to verify the functionality of the `TimecodeEncoder` module:

```verilog
module TimecodeEncoder_TB;

  reg [3:0] hours;
  reg [6:0] minutes;
  reg [6:0] seconds;
  reg [23:0] frames;
  wire [79:0] timecode;

  TimecodeEncoder dut (
    .hours(hours),
    .minutes(minutes),
    .seconds(seconds),
    .frames(frames),
    .timecode(timecode)
  );

  initial begin
    $dumpfile("timecode_encoder_tb.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, TimecodeEncoder_TB);

    hours = 3'b011; // Example input values
    minutes = 7'b0010101;
    seconds = 7'b0101100;
    frames = 24'b101011101100110010101100;

    #10;
    $finish;
  end

endmodule
```

In the test bench, example values are assigned to `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, and `frames`. The output `timecode` is monitored. The simulation is run for a specified period of time, in this case, `#10`, to observe the waveform output. After the simulation finishes, the `$finish` statement ends the simulation.

To simulate and verify the functionality, you can use a Verilog simulator, such as ModelSim or Icarus Verilog, by running the following commands:

```bash
iverilog -o timecode_encoder_tb TimecodeEncoder.v TimecodeEncoder_TB.v
vvp timecode_encoder_tb
gtkwave timecode_encoder_tb.vcd
```

The above commands compile the Verilog files, simulate the test bench, and open the waveform viewer GTKWave to visualize the results.

You can modify the test bench inputs with different values to verify the correctness of the `TimecodeEncoder` module.
